# Star Citizen String Translation Merger Tool
> [!NOTE]
> Originally based on [ExoAE's ScCompLangPack](https://github.com/ExoAE/ScCompLangPack) idea but rather than another fork, I decided instead to tweak the merge tool to make it more usable. target_strings.ini is provided for example of organising your ASOP

> [!WARNING]
> Although I have created a tool to eliminate manual process. If you are uneasy in running it, or unrestricting PowerShell, you can still manually adjust your localization file by just searching for the strings `CTRL`+`F` or simply running a find & replace with `CTRL`+`H`

### 🗒️ Current String Base: `sc-alpha-4.3.2.10452200`

## 📝 What it Does
- Takes `target_strings.ini` as the input file & `global.ini` as source file from Data.p4k
- Finds the keys from input, matches them to source and replaces the value
- Outputs `merged.ini`
- Optionally outputs directly to the specified game file. See code comments in `merge-translations.ps1` for details

## 🗺️ Usage
1. Find the strings you want to customize in `src/global.ini` or `src/vehicles.ini`
2. Copy the line(s) to `target_strings.ini`
3. If you already have a `user.cfg` file in `StarCitizen\LIVE` add the line `g_language = english`
    - If not, create one or copy `src\user.example.cfg` and rename it to `user.cfg`
4. If you want to write localization straight to game folder
    - Open `merge-translations.ps1` in notepad (or other text editor)
        1. Define your folder if not default
        2. Change `$gameIniWrite = $false` to `$gameIniWrite = $true`
5. Right click `merge-translations.ps1` & select *Run in Powershell*
    - If prompted, input `r` then press `enter` to run the tool
6. You can verify the changes have taken effect by going to your install location → `data\Localization\english\global.ini` & searching for one of your strings using `CTRL`+`F`

## 🛠️ General Localization Installation
- Any translations (localization) files you download should go in your Star Citizen install folder (LIVE, PTU, TECH-PREVIEW etc.) in the following structure:
```
StarCitizen/
└── LIVE/
    ├── user.cfg
    └── data/
        └── Localization/
            └── english/
                └── global.ini
```
- If you already have a `user.cfg` file, add the line `g_language = english`
    - Otherwise just make one or rename `user.example.cfg` → `user.cfg` & put it in your SC directory as above

## ⁉️ Win11 Gave an Error

> [!CAUTION]
> Certain operating system versions may require you to unrestrict PowerShell execution in order to run the unsigned script. You can either look-up how to self-sign, or unrestrict and do so at your own risk
> - Changing execution policy is done by running PowerShell as admin
> - [Microsoft Info on Execution Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.5&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.2)
> - When you are done ensure you then revert to only running signed scripts

Unrestricting:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
Reverting to default:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
To block scripts:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
